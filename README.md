Hello and Welcome! 

This is a simple and easy read-me. 

1) You can open the files in a IDE and look at the code. 

2) You can go to dist and run the executable Jar File. 
      When you run the file you have the option to start from scratch or start with the map that was provided. Once you are done creating         the map, you need to set the 'start' and 'goal' points within the map. 
      To set or remove points right click on a vertex and click the desired option. Once both 'goal' and 'start' points are picked choose         which algorithm you want to use from the menu at the top of the application.
